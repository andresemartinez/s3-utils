# S3 Utils
S3 utils is a collection of scripts to handle a local-stack s3 instance easily.

## Instalation
Give +x permission to all the files in the `scripts` folder.
**Pro tip:** Run the s3-aliases script to get cool aliases and xclip them to your rc file of choice.

## Requirements
The scripts assume that you have a running local-stack s3 instance and awslocal installed.
